# Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between the lead notification days when there is a planned service outage and customer satisfaction and service assurance within the telecommunications industry. This was measured by exploring the number of customer trouble tickets filed by impacted customers on the days of the outage. Planned outages are unavoidable as they play a role in improving current services and investing in the next generation innovations delivered by the network and it would be unreasonable for a customer to expect no impact on services. If a significant relationship was found, then the telecommunications company could better communicate outage notices and improve their relationship with the customer. This study was performed via the scientific method and leveraged existing data from a global telecommunications industry. It was an aggregated view of the last 27 months of planned outages (GCRâ€™s) that had a customer impact with appended counts of correlated customer trouble tickets filed in the company customer relationship management system. Various statistical tests were applied to test hypotheses and base assumptions and measure the strength of the relationships in the data with the end goal of generating a linear regression algorithm to predict the optimal notification timeframe. The study found a weak correlation between the lead notification days and filed customer trouble tickets in the data set. Due to the weak correlation the model generated performed no better than random chance and further exploration is needed in this area. Recommendations for the continuing exploration include getting a more granular dataset as well as collecting qualitative data from surveys sent out to customers that have experienced an outage.
